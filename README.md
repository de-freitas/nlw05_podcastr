# This is **Podcastr**!

### **About:**

"**Podcastr**" was developed during NextLevelWeek 5, promoted by [Rocketseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/). In total there were 5 classes with a lot of technical content and lots of hands-on work to develop the project. It was made in React, covering current technologies such as Next.js, Typescript and SCSS.
